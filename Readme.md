# Backend Proposal – AI Study Companion Platform (Intern Assignment)

## 1. Tech Stack Recommendation

| Layer              | Technology                                 | Reason                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backend Framework** | Node.js (Express) or Django (Python)        | Simple, scalable, and fast for APIs. Django for Python-based AI integration, Express for speed and flexibility. |
| **Database**          | PostgreSQL                                 | Powerful relational DB with strong integrity and indexing, perfect for structured student & quiz data. |
| **Hosting**           | AWS (EC2/RDS)                              | Easy deployment, scalable, student-ready platform. Free tier for testing. |
| **Authentication**    | JWT (Firebase Auth or Django Allauth)      | Secure, scalable login with options for OAuth (Google) integration. |
| **AI Integration**    | Python (FastAPI or Celery workers)         | Ideal for integrating AI models like OpenAI, Cohere, or custom NLP. |
| **Caching/Queues**    | Redis                                      | Handles background jobs like scoring, notifications, and user activity logs. |

## 2. Backend Structure for AI-Enhanced Exam Preparation
/backend

├── auth/ # User login, registration, roles (admin/student)

├── exams/ # SAT/IELTS content (quizzes, questions, levels)

├── ai_services/ # AI tools: answer explanations, essay grading, tips

├── progress_tracking/ # User progress, streaks, scores

├── notifications/ # Reminders, motivational messages (optional)

├── utils/ # Helpers: scoring logic, AI API calls


### AI Tools Examples

- **Essay Grader** using OpenAI GPT or a custom BERT model.
- **Adaptive Quiz Engine** that recommends questions based on performance trends.

## 3. Scalability & Data Privacy

### Scalability

- Stateless backend with REST API or GraphQL.
- Load balancing with Nginx for traffic distribution.
- Background tasks via **Celery + Redis**.
- Vertical scaling on Render or horizontal scaling with **Kubernetes (AWS/GCP)**.

### Student Data Privacy

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data (e.g., essays).
- Encrypted PostgreSQL volumes for storage.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to separate admin and student privileges.

## Bonus Feature – AI Study Buddy

An interactive, AI-powered chat tool for student queries like:

- "Explain this grammar rule"
- "Give me 5 SAT-style math questions on functions"
- "Why is my essay weak?"
